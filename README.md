# GreedyGameTask

The idea behind the project is to create the ability to search multiple resources sites parallely for a single request made to your API.
For example, if the text string was “the dark knight”, this request can be initiated by the user with the cUrl command as simple as:

``` curl "http://greedygametask.herokuapp.com?q=the+dark+knight" ```

API presents a response within 1 sec for combining the search results.

The entry point to the app is : ``` "server.py" ```
